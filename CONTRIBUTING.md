## Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug on the project's [issues page](https://github.com/FoodEssentials/<Repo Name>/issues),
first make sure that your issue is caused by <Repo Name>, not your application code
(e.g. passing incorrect arguments to methods, etc.).
Second, search the already reported issues for similar cases,
and if it's already reported, just add any additional details in the comments.

After you've made sure that you've found a new <Repo Name> bug,
here are some tips for creating a helpful report that will make fixing it much easier and quicker:

 * Write a **descriptive, specific title**. Bad: *Unknown Error*. Good: *Doing X causes a Runtime Error*..
 * Description of the issue you are solving, and how you are doing it (if complicated)

### Considerations for Accepting Patches

Before sending a pull request with a new feature, check if it's been discussed before already
on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/FoodEssentials/<Repo Name>/issues):

If your feature or API improvement did get merged into master,
please consider submitting another pull request with a corresponding documentation update.

### Making Changes to a Label Insight Source

If you're not yet familiar with the way GitHub works (forking, pull requests, etc.),
be sure to check out the awesome [article about forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
on the GitHub Help website &mdash; it will get you started quickly.

You should always write each batch of changes (feature, bugfix, etc.) in **its own topic branch**.
Please do not commit to the `master` branch, or your unrelated changes will go into the same pull request.

You should also follow the code style and whitespace conventions of the original codebase.

Also, please make sure that you have [line endings configured properly](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings) in Git! Otherwise the diff will show that all lines of a file were changed even if you touched only one.

Happy coding!

## Testing
